# Factorio-Wiki-Scripts
Scripts that I have developed for my work on the Factorio Wiki


I have developed this script to help me translate the Factorio wiki to Italian. The script is very rough and a lot of manual work will still be needed but at least it saves about 50% of the work on the basic template that applies all over the wiki.
